          <h3> JEWELLERY EXTENSIONS COMING OFF</h3>

          <p class="text-justify">Beads & other extensions coming off is one of the common problem with jewellery. Though its least reported in our experience by now. But the beauty is always associated with delicacy. So yes, these pretty things are delicate and breakable. Handle with care and don’t panic if pearls, beads or any other jewellery extensions come off because it won’t make you look any less prettier at the part since they won’t be visible until and unless paid very close attention to with a magnifying glass. Though, We are always here to help you with it. You can email us or report it in complaints section or give us a call about it. If its repairable, you can do it too. We can send you a tutorial video where we show you how to do it or arrange a video call for you where we guide you with the repair of your jewel.

          If these extensions were off when you received the order, you can immediately report the refund (read details under the damage section above)</p>
</br>
          <h3 >COLOR DISCLAIMER</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">Most of the stones used in our jewellery pieces are translucent I.e. they allow some amount of the light to pass through it, which is why they have a little wide array of colours reflection in some cases which might become more darker or brighter in colour depending on what kind of light they are being seeing in.

        You might even find the difference in multiple pictures of a single product. For instance; when kept over a base/table the colour of the stones might seem to be on darker side, whereas when hung over the mannequin, it might get a little brighter because of more light finding its way to pass through it when hung. But instead of editing the colours to make them match. We preferred keeping it real to deliver the right picture to you and help you making the right choice.</p>
